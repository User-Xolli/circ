2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell q[0]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) q_reg[0]/F1/CLR, q_reg[0]/L7/CLR, q_reg[0]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell q[0]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) q_reg[0]/F2/PRE, q_reg[0]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell q[1]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) q_reg[1]/F1/CLR, q_reg[1]/L7/CLR, q_reg[1]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#4 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell q[1]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) q_reg[1]/F2/PRE, q_reg[1]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell q[2]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) q_reg[2]/F1/CLR, q_reg[2]/L7/CLR, q_reg[2]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#6 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell q[2]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) q_reg[2]/F2/PRE, q_reg[2]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#7 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell q[3]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) q_reg[3]/F1/CLR, q_reg[3]/L7/CLR, q_reg[3]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#8 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell q[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) q_reg[3]/F2/PRE, q_reg[3]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
