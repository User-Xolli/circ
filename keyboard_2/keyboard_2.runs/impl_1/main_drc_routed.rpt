2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net q[0]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin q[0]_i_2/O, cell q[0]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net q[1]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin q[1]_i_2/O, cell q[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net q[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin q[2]_i_2/O, cell q[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net q[3]_i_3_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin q[3]_i_3/O, cell q[3]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net zero is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin q[3]_i_1/O, cell q[3]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT q[3]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 12 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
q_reg[0]/F1 (in q_reg[0] macro), q_reg[0]/F2 (in q_reg[0] macro), q_reg[0]_P, q_reg[1]/F1 (in q_reg[1] macro), q_reg[1]/F2 (in q_reg[1] macro), q_reg[1]_P, q_reg[2]/F1 (in q_reg[2] macro), q_reg[2]/F2 (in q_reg[2] macro), q_reg[2]_P, q_reg[3]/F1 (in q_reg[3] macro), q_reg[3]/F2 (in q_reg[3] macro), q_reg[3]_P
Related violations: <none>
